**HTML and CSS**
I started by structuring the website with semantic HTML to enhance accessibility and clarity. Key elements included the use of proper tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>, ensuring a clear hierarchy with appropriate heading tags from <h1> to <h6>. Accessible forms were created with well-defined labels and inputs.

**Advanced CSS**
To ensure the website was fully responsive, I employed CSS media queries, adopting a mobile-first approach. This allowed the layout and font sizes to adjust seamlessly across different devices. For layout management, I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox. CSS Grid was used for the main layout structure, offering a flexible and responsive grid system, while Flexbox was applied within containers to align and distribute space efficiently.

Subtle animations and transitions were added to enhance user experience. Hover effects on buttons and links, along with keyframe animations for various elements, created engaging visual effects without overwhelming the user.

**Next.js**
Next.js was configured for server-side rendering, improving both performance and SEO. I created several pages, including Home, About, Events, and Contact, and set up dynamic routes for event details. This combination of static and dynamic content management allowed for a versatile and efficient website structure.


**Performance and Optimization**
Performance was a key focus. I implemented code splitting and lazy loading to ensure only necessary code was loaded initially, reducing load times. Responsive images were served based on the user's device, and modern image formats like WebP were used for better compression and quality.
