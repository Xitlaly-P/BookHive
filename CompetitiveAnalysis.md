# Competitive Analysis

My business is a small family owned bookstore that features a cafe and a lounge for events to be held such as book clubs,.movie nights, board game nights, and more. This bookstore will be called the Book Hive and it is based on the idea of community and bringing a safe place for people to go when they want. With this in mind the archetype of my business is the Everyman. 

## Persuasion

For this website I will be using social proof as a form of persuasion by including reviews from customers as well as saying "Join your community". I will also be using reciprocity by giving people who sign up for the news letter a free baked good from the cafe. In this new letter there will be advertisments for the events that are hosted and books at the store.
