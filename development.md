## HTML and CSS

I started by structuring the website with semantic HTML to enhance accessibility and clarity. Key elements included:

- Use of proper tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- Ensured a clear hierarchy with appropriate heading tags from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
- Created accessible forms with well-defined labels and inputs.

## Advanced CSS

To ensure the website was fully responsive, I employed CSS media queries with a mobile-first approach. This allowed the layout and font sizes to adjust seamlessly across different devices. For layout management, I utilized:

- **CSS Grid**: Used for the main layout structure, providing a flexible and responsive grid system.
- **Flexbox**: Applied within containers to align and distribute space efficiently.

## Next.js

Next.js was configured for server-side rendering to enhance performance and SEO. Key implementations include:

- Creation of several pages: Home, About, Events, and Contact.
- Setup of dynamic routes for event details.
- Combination of static and dynamic content management for a versatile and efficient website structure.

## Performance and Optimization

Performance was a key focus, and several techniques were implemented to optimize load times:

- **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**: Ensured only necessary code was loaded initially.
- **Responsive Images**: Served based on the user's device, using modern image formats like WebP for better compression and quality.
